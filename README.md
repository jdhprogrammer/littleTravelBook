### Description

```
Welcome to Project 2! This is yet another important milestone in your 
full-stack journey: designing and building your first full-stack web 
application. You and your team will design and build an app using the 
MVC paradigm and your own server-side API. You will also continue to 
add to your professional repertoire with testing, continuous integration 
and linting tools.
```

#### User Story

```
As a Traveler. I want to have a online Journal where I can write about 
my different fun amazing travels around the world or my city. I want 
to be able to save journal entries and upload photos. I would also enjoy 
being able to share some of those journal entries as posts for friends 
or the world to see. And then of course read travel posts shared by others.
```

#### More Details

```
The user is able to Signup as a Traveler. They create a login. 
they have a user homepage which will display their most recent 
posts and give them direct access their journal and photos, 
sort of a profile page for yourself. Then they can write new 
journal entries. they can check if they would like these journal 
entries to be shared with the public. You can view all the other 
users that have shared posts. You can view all posts or view 
posts by specific travelers.
```
